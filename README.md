# FPGA Sort
**FPGA Sort** is a sorting library for FPGA implementation.
This has a hardware engine in RTL to perform the sorting process and call it a library from the OpenCL kernel code.
The engine is built by combining the following three hardware sorting algorithms: the sorting network, high-bandwidth merge sorter tree, and virtual merge sorter tree.
